### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

When everyone told me to stop, I kept running, faster, faster, faster...

              I still running, I forgot how to stop.
              
              RPM: 95>. 59/60 :S
About the last challenge is: The amount of figures inside means "-(fig_amount)", and with the amount of figures outside mean "+(fig_amount)".
Working on some crud, gotta show off my skills so people can believe me, since a some people think I can't do what I do, so... Lets put on work!
